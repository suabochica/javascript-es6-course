Next Generation JavaScript: Intro to EcmaScript 2015/ES6
====================================================

Before to start with the new standard of JavaScript we have to take attention to the next standard versions considerations:

1. ES5
    - Standard fully supported in all modern browser.
    - Ready to be used since 2016.
2. ES6/ES2015 
    - Standard partially supported in modern browsers, no support in older browsers.
    - Can't use it in production in 2016. You have to setup a transpiler.
3. ES2016, ES2017
    - Standard no support in morder browsers
    - Can't use it in production in 2016. You have to setup a transpiler.

Below a list with the ES6 feaures we will cover in this section:

- Variables Declarations with `let` and `const`
- Blocks and IIFEs
- Strings
- Arrow Functions (Maybe the most important feature)
- Destructuring
- Arrays
- The Spread Operator
- Rest and Default Parameters
- Maps
- Classes and subclasses
- How to use ES2015/ES6 today
