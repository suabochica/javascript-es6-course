Next Generation JavaScript: Intro to EcmaScript 2015/ES6
========================================================

Before to start with the new standard of JavaScript we have to take attention to the next standard versions considerations:

1. ES5
    - Standard fully supported in all modern browser.
    - Ready to be used since 2016.
2. ES6/ES2015 
    - Standard partially supported in modern browsers, no support in older browsers.
    - Can't use it in production in 2016. You have to setup a transpiler.
3. ES2016, ES2017
    - Standard no support in morder browsers
    - Can't use it in production in 2016. You have to setup a transpiler.

Below a list with the ES6 feaures we will cover in this section:

- Variables Declarations with `let` and `const`
- Blocks and IIFEs
- Strings
- Arrow Functions (Maybe the most important feature)
- Destructuring
- Arrays
- The Spread Operator
- Rest and Default Parameters
- Maps
- Classes and subclasses
- How to use ES2015/ES6 today

Please check [the comparative table of the ES6 features supported by browser](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).

Variable Declarations with `let` and `const`
--------------------------------------------

We can introduce the keywords `let` and `const` with comparative `var` examples:

```javascript
//ES5
var i = 21;

for(var i = 0; i > 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

console.log(i); //-> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

//ES6

let j = 21;

for(let i = 0; j > 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); //-> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
}

console.log(j); //-> 21
```

As you can see, the outputs in the console are different when you use `let` variable declaration. That is due to the scope associated with each keyword. Now let's check an example with `const`;

```javascript
//ES5
function statalLicense5(passedTest) {
    if(passedTest) {
        var firstName = 'Edward Elric';
        var yearOfBirth = `1990`;
    }
    
    console.log(firstName + ', born in ' + + ', is now officially a statal alchemist')
}


//ES6
function statalLicense6(passedTest) {
    if(passedTest) {
        let firstName = 'Edward Elric';
        const yearOfBirth = `1990`;
        console.log(firstName + ', born in ' + + ', is now officially a statal alchemist')
    }
    
    // console.log(firstName + ', born in ' + + ', is now officially a statal alchemist') //-> Throw ReferenceError: firstName is not defined.
}
```

After this examples we have the next conclusions:

- Use `let` to define variables that will change his value (as indexes).
- Use `const` to define variables that will **not** change his value (as a year of birth).
- `let`and `const` are variables definitions block-scoped and `var` is function-scoped. A block is all the code wrapped by `{}`.
- You can't define a `const` var definition outside of the block where you will use the variable.
- `let`and `const` are variables with **temporal-dead zone**. This means that the variables are hoisted, but we still cannot access them before they are declared.

Blocks and IIFEs
----------------

The concept of **block-scoped** is related to data privacy. Remember that in ES5 we get data privacy through IIFEs. In ES6 we can cleanly define data privacy but we have to take care of some considerations. The next code is an example of data privacy in ES6 with block-scoped and his equivalent in ES5:

```javascript
//ES5

(function({
    var a = 1;
})();

console.log(a) //-> Uncaught ReferenceError.


//ES6
{
    let b = 2;
    const c = 3;
    var d = 4;
}

console.log(b + c) //-> Uncaught ReferenceError.
console.log(4); //-> 4
```

As you can see, if you try to access the de variables `b` and `c` out of the block-scope you will get a reference error. However, if you see the `d` variable we have access to it, and this is because we declare the variables using the `var` keyword, then the variable is function-scoped instead of block-scoped, allowing then the access to it.

String in ES6
-------------

A good improvement of ES6 is the handle on `string`. The next code is an example of how we had to manage string in ES5:

```javascript
var firstName = "Edward";
var lastName = "Elric";
var yearOfBirth = 1990;

function calculateAge(yearOfBirth) {
    return 2018 - yearOfBirth;
}

console.log('This is '+ firstName + ' ' + lastName - '. He born in ' + yearOfBirth + '. Today, he is ' + calculateAge(yearOfBirth) + ' years old.' );

```

Now, ES6 offer the feature of **literal templates**. This is a new and clean way to use strings in JavaScript. The next code is the last example for ES6:

```javascript
let firstName = "Edward";
let lastName = "Elric";
const yearOfBirth = 1990;

function calculateAge(yearOfBirth) {
    return 2018 - yearOfBirth;
}

console.log(`This is ${firstName} ${lastName}. He was born in ${yearOfBirth}. Today he is ${calculateAge(yearOfBirth)} years old`);
```

Now it is easier read this strings. Also the `String` primitive now has some impressive methods:

```javascript
const name = 'Edward Elric';

console.log(name.startsWith('E')) //-> true
console.log(name.startsWith('e')) //-> false
console.log(name.endsWith('c')) //-> true
console.log(name.endsWith('x')) //-> false
console.log(name.startsWith('E')) //-> true
console.log(name.includes(' ')) //-> true
console.log(`${name} `.repeat(3)) //-> Edward Elric Edward Elric Edward Elric
```

Arrow Functions
---------------

To explain the arrow functions let's consider the next example: Imagine that we want to calculate the age for each year stored in an array. Below the solution in ES5:

```javascript
//ES5
const years = [1991, 1958, 1962, 1982, 1984, 1995];

var ages5 = years.map(function(element){
    return 2018 - element;
});

console.log(ages5); //-> [27, 60, 56, 36, 34, 23]
```

Now it's time to solve this problem with arrow functions. The arrow function has the next three scenarios:

- When the callback function has just one argument and one line of code.
- When the callback function has several arguments and one line of code.
- When the callback function has several arguments and several lines of codes.

Check these scenarios in the next code:

As you can see, arrow functions use the **arrow operator** `=>` to reduce the syntax of the callback functions in ES5. That is just a sketch of the improvements proposed in ES6 with arrow functions.

```javascript
//ES6
const years = [1991, 1958, 1962, 1982, 1984, 1995];
let ages6 = years.map(element => 2018 - element);

ages6 = years.map((element, index) => console.log(`Age element ${index + 1}: ${element}`));
/**
Will print in console:
[
    Age element 1: 1991,
    Age element 2: 1958,
    Age element 3: 1962,
    Age element 4: 1982,
    Age element 5: 1984,
    Age element 6: 1995,
]
*/

ages6 = years.map((element, index) => {
    let now = new Date().getFullYear();
    const age = now - element;
 
    return `Age element ${index + 1}: ${age}`
});
console.log(ages6);
/**
Will print in console:
[
    Age element 1: 27,
    Age element 2: 60,
    Age element 3: 56,
    Age element 4: 36,
    Age element 5: 34,
    Age element 6: 23,
]
*/

```

As you can see, arrow functions use the **arrow operator** `=>` to reduce the syntax of the callback functions in ES5. That is just a sketch of the improvements proposed in ES6 with arrow functions.

Arrow Functions: Lexical `this` keyword
---------------------------------------

One of the most significant advantages of using arrow functions is that they *share the surrounding `this` keyword*. This behavior is described as **lexical `this` variable**. In other words, unlike normal functions, arrow functions don't get their own `this` keyword. 

Please check the `box5` example in the file `script.js`. If you remember in previous sections. In a method call, the `this` keyword effectively points to the expected object. But, in regular functions, the `this` keyword will always point to the global object (i.e., the window object). It is for that reason that the `clickMe()` method has the context of the `box5` object but the callback function of the `addEventListener()` isn't. To hack the expected behavior of preserve the expected `this` context, developer use two patterns:

- Store the `this` context in a variable and then used it. This variable is frequently called `self`.
- Use the `bind()` method of the function constructor object to set the `this` keyword manually, creating a copy of the function. We cant use `call()` or `apply()` because them call the function immediately.

With arrow functions aren't necessary to use these strategies thanks to the lexical this keyword feature.

> Do you have to be careful when using arrow functions at the moment of the track the surrounding this context shared. If you define an arrow function in a global scope that has a child arrow function, this child arrow function will have the `this` context of the global scope instead of the parent function.
