Next Generation JavaScript: Intro to EcmaScript 2015/ES6
========================================================

Before to start with the new standard of JavaScript we have to take attention to the next standard versions considerations:

1. ES5
    - Standard fully supported in all modern browser.
    - Ready to be used since 2016.
2. ES6/ES2015 
    - Standard partially supported in modern browsers, no support in older browsers.
    - Can't use it in production in 2016. You have to setup a transpiler.
3. ES2016, ES2017
    - Standard no support in morder browsers
    - Can't use it in production in 2016. You have to setup a transpiler.

Below a list with the ES6 feaures we will cover in this section:

- Variables Declarations with `let` and `const`
- Blocks and IIFEs
- Strings
- Arrow Functions (Maybe the most important feature)
- Destructuring
- Arrays
- The Spread Operator
- Rest and Default Parameters
- Maps
- Classes and subclasses
- How to use ES2015/ES6 today

Please check [the comparative table of the ES6 features supported by browser](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).

Variable Declarations with `let` and `const`
--------------------------------------------

We can introduce the keywords `let` and `const` with comparative `var` examples:

```javascript
//ES5
var i = 21;

for(var i = 0; i > 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

console.log(i); //-> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

//ES6

let j = 21;

for(let i = 0; j > 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); //-> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
}

console.log(j); //-> 21
```

As you can see, the outputs in the console are different when you use `let` variable declaration. That is due to the scope associated with each keyword. Now let's check an example with `const`;

```javascript
//ES5
function statalLicense5(passedTest) {
    if(passedTest) {
        var firstName = 'Edward Elric';
        var yearOfBirth = `1990`;
    }
    
    console.log(firstName + ', born in ' + + ', is now officially a statal alchemist')
}


//ES6
function statalLicense6(passedTest) {
    if(passedTest) {
        let firstName = 'Edward Elric';
        const yearOfBirth = `1990`;
        console.log(firstName + ', born in ' + + ', is now officially a statal alchemist')
    }
    
    // console.log(firstName + ', born in ' + + ', is now officially a statal alchemist') //-> Throw ReferenceError: firstName is not defined.
}
```

After this examples we have the next conclusions:

- Use `let` to define variables that will change his value (as indexes).
- Use `const` to define variables that will **not** change his value (as a year of birth).
- `let`and `const` are variables definitions block-scoped and `var` is function-scoped. A block is all the code wrapped by `{}`.
- You can't define a `const` var definition outside of the block where you will use the variable.
- `let`and `const` are variables with **temporal-dead zone**. This means that the variables are hoisted, but we still cannot access them before they are declared.
