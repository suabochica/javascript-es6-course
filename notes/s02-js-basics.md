Introduction to JavaScript
==========================

What is JavaScript?
-------------------

_JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented computer programming language_

- *lightweight* means that is a language don't use much of memory of the computer and is compose by a simple syntax and features.
- *cross-platform*  means that can be use in multiple platforms and systems.
- *object-oriented* means that it is a language based in objects.

JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the web development, so is most commonly used as a part of web pages. Today JavaScript can be used in different places:

- Client-side: JavaScript was traditionally only used in the browser.
- Server-side: Thanks to *node.js*, we can use JavaScript on the server as well.

JavaScript is what made modern web development possible through dynamic effects and interactivity. It is important to mention that today there are a ton of JavaScript libraries and frameworks out there that implement different architectures and help developers build complex apps more easily and faster than ever. All these libraries and frameworks  are just based in JavaScript, and so before using them developers need to be really good at JavaScript, they need to really understand it.

> What is the differences between library an Framework?
> *Library*: A library is just a file with functions/methods or other reusable code that you can link and use it in your own code.
> *Framework*: A framework is a broad term. Wikipedia says that framework is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality. Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that bring together all the different components to enable development of a project or system.
